# Instabot
Developed a sophisticated Instagram Automation Bot for an online clothing
brand called [Colourful Silhouettes](https://www.instagram.com/colourful_silhouettes/) using Python and Selenium, boosting the
follower count by 6% (from 2,440 to 2,600) within just 7 days.

Engineered functions to extract follower usernames from similar brands, and
executed automated follow/unfollow actions, increasing the user engagement
by more than 20%.

Implemented a dynamic feature to like/unlike the top 30 posts of competing
Instagram clothing brands, enhancing the brandâ€™s visibility and interaction on
the platform.
